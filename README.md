# Dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles, containing many random, useful but mostly useless scripts I've used. Most of the scripts are under i3/ , herbstluftwm/ , bspwm/ . They're not in a separate scripts folder yet, because I wanted to separate scripts that I used for certain WMs only.
## Questions
You really shouldn't be cloning my dotfiles as they are as convoluted as possible. That's just how my brain works when unattended, sorry.
I'm available on discord, and github issues whenever, if you happen to stumble upon this page... somehow. As you've most likely found this page from Unixporn discord, you most likely know that I'm just a mention away.
